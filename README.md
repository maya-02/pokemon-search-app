# Pok√©mon Search App

## Overview

The **Pok√©mon Search App** is a simple and intuitive web application that allows users to search for information on any Pok√©mon by entering its name or ID number. The app uses the Pok√©API to fetch real-time data and display details like the Pok√©mon's stats, types, height, weight, and an image of the Pok√©mon.

## Features

- **Real-Time Search**: Users can search for any Pok√©mon by name or ID number.
- **Pok√©mon Stats**: Displays important stats such as HP, Attack, Defense, and more.
- **Types**: Shows the type(s) of the Pok√©mon, color-coded by type (e.g., Electric, Fire, Water).
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and adjusts to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Image Display**: Shows a sprite image of the Pok√©mon.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, minimalistic UI with simple search functionality and clear results.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and ensuring responsiveness across different devices.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Used to fetch data from the API, process user input, and update the DOM with the fetched Pok√©mon data.
- **Pok√©API**: The app pulls data from the Pok√©API to get real-time information on Pok√©mon.

## How to Use

1. Access the app through the **[GitHub Pages link](your-github-pages-link-here)**.
2. Enter the name or ID of a Pok√©mon into the search bar (e.g., "Pikachu", "25").
3. Click the **Search** button.
4. The app will fetch and display the Pok√©mon‚Äôs details, including:
   - Pok√©mon name and ID number.
   - Sprite image.
   - Weight and height.
   - Base stats like HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.
   - Pok√©mon type(s), color-coded for better readability.
5. If the Pok√©mon is not found, an alert will notify the user, and the results section will be cleared.

## Installation & Setup

If you want to run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-search-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pokemon-search-app
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

No server-side setup is required as this app runs entirely on the client side and fetches data directly from the Pok√©API.
